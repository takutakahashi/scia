# scia

SaaS credential injector for agents.

`scia` is a Go forward proxy that lets agents call upstream APIs without storing shared OAuth clients, API keys, or long-lived tokens locally. It loads policy and credential configuration, injects authentication headers into outbound requests, and can deny or hold sensitive requests until an operator approves them.

## Features

- Forward proxy for HTTP requests with credential injection.
- Credential types: bearer token, basic auth, static header, and OAuth2 client credentials.
- Policy rules by host, method, and path with `allow`, `deny`, or `approval` actions.
- Blocking approval flow exposed through local admin endpoints.
- Reloadable configuration through a provider interface. The first adapter is YAML from the filesystem; database and AWS Secrets Manager providers can be added behind the same `config.Provider` interface.
- Container image and GitHub Actions release flow managed by semantic version tags.

## HTTPS limitation

For standard HTTPS forward proxy traffic, clients use `CONNECT`, and the proxy only sees the destination host. `scia` can allow, deny, or require approval for `CONNECT` by host, but it cannot inspect paths or inject headers inside the encrypted tunnel without becoming a TLS-intercepting proxy. Header injection applies to HTTP absolute-form requests handled by the proxy.

## Run locally

```sh
go run ./cmd/scia -config configs/example.yaml -listen :8080
```

Configure an HTTP client to use `http://127.0.0.1:8080` as its proxy.

Admin endpoints:

- `GET /_scia/healthz`
- `GET /_scia/approvals`
- `POST /_scia/approvals/{id}/approve`
- `POST /_scia/approvals/{id}/deny`

If `server.adminToken` is set, admin requests must include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Config values with the `env:` prefix are read from environment variables.

## Configuration

See [configs/example.yaml](configs/example.yaml).

Rules are evaluated in order. If no rule matches, the request is allowed without credential injection.

## Build

```sh
make test
make build
make image
```

The Docker image defaults to `ghcr.io/takutakahashi/scia:<VERSION>`.

## Release

Releases use semantic versioning. Update [VERSION](VERSION), create a matching tag with a `v` prefix, and push it:

```sh
printf "0.2.0\n" > VERSION
git commit -am "chore: release 0.2.0"
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin main v0.2.0
```

The release workflow runs GoReleaser, publishes GitHub release artifacts, and pushes multi-architecture container images to GHCR.

See [docs/release.md](docs/release.md) for the release checklist.
